# Phage Genomic Classification using DNA Foundation Models ‚Äì Phagos x Hackdays 2025

## üß¨ Scientific Context

Bacteriophages (phages), viruses that infect bacteria, play a central role in microbial ecology and phage therapy. Yet, understanding their diversity and behavior in metagenomic samples remains a significant challenge.

**Our goal**: harness the representational power of DNA-specific foundation models to address two key questions:
1. **Can we isolate phage contigs from complex metagenomic mixtures?**
2. **Can we infer a phage‚Äôs life cycle‚Äîvirulent or temperate‚Äîdirectly from its genomic sequence?**

## üöÄ Hackathon Context

This project was developed during the **[Phagos x AWS ‚Äî Hackdays 2025](https://phagos-rd-hackathon25-datasets.s3.eu-west-1.amazonaws.com/phagos_aws_hackathon_kick_off.pdf)**, held in Paris. In 48 hours, we built an end-to-end, biology-informed ML pipeline that combines metagenomic insights with cutting-edge genomic representation models.

## üß¨ Method Overview

### 1. Dataset Integration & Fragmentation

We combined two public datasets:
- **Dataset 1** ‚Äì Metagenomic fragments (bacteria, plasmids, phages)
- **Dataset 2** ‚Äì DeePhage phages with life cycle annotations

We ensured high-confidence labeling by retaining only overlapping phage entries between datasets and fragmenting sequences with the script from the *Gauge your phage* benchmark study.

> ‚û°Ô∏è Final classes: `Viru` (virulent phage), `Temp` (temperate phage), `Bact` (bacterial contigs)

### 2. Embedding via DNA Foundation Model

We employed [Evo](https://github.com/evo-design/evo), a transformer-based foundation model trained for molecular sequences. The Evo encoder transforms genomic fragments into dense vector representations capturing sequence-level semantics beyond motifs or k-mers.

### 3. Model Architecture

- Jupyter-based PyTorch pipeline
- Evo embeddings fed to a shallow classifier
- 3-way prediction task (Viru / Temp / Bact)
- Mixed precision training with AMP (`autocast`, `GradScaler`)
- Performance monitored using `accuracy_score` and confusion matrices
